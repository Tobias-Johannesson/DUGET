# Dynamic User Grouping and Evolution Tracking (DUGET)
This framework contains the following steps: representing objects, preparing these for clustering, object cluster for two time periods, tracking/matching clusters over time, and evaluation/quantifying change.

DUGET_V1 and DUGET_V2 are two implementations using public transportation data representing users by their temporal profiles. User profiles found are robust over time showing the frameworks ability to find distinct patterns and track these over time.
